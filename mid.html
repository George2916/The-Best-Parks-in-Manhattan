          <div class="panel-heading">Bryant Park
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">The lawn is lush and green and the flowers change seasonally but Bryant Park is more than a garden. When you first discover it, nestled in its canyon of skyscrapers, it’s like an oasis–a refuge of peace and calm. But Bryant Park is a city park, full of historical monuments and urban amenities. The park is a social place where friends meet, eat lunch, chat, stroll, listen to music, work on the wireless network, or simply sit and think. Winter, summer, spring, and fall, New Yorkers love this park.<br>
          <b>Location:</b> Bryant Park is situated behind the New York Public Library in midtown Manhattan, between 40th and 42nd Streets & Fifth and Sixth Avenues.

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">This is one of the city's most dog-friendly--two dog runs offer plenty of space for pups to run around and mingle, while the promenade offers a lovely place to stroll, with or without a furry companion. A playground at the end of the park holds fun for kids of all ages. The park's plentiful green space is a lovely place for reading, picnicking, people-watching, and, when the weather gets nice, sunbathing.<br>

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">Hidden amongst the office buildings, this park provides a welcome respite from the concrete jungle. It was designed by the landscape  architectural  firm of Zion & Breen. Since it opened on May 23, 1967, the park has been favored by both midtown businessmen and those tourists who happen upon it. A waterfall, trees, and ivy covered walls transport visitors to an oasis and away from the sights and sounds of the city.<br>

          <div class="panel-body"> Stretching four miles from 62nd to 158th Streets along the Hudson River, is Manhattan's most spectacular waterfront park. Since 1875, the landscapes of Frederick Law Olmsted have offered escape from the city and opportunities for people of all incomes to relax, play, and socialize in tranquil settings.<br>
