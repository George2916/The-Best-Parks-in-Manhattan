          <div class="panel-body">Named in honor of a Revolutionary War fort that was located nearby, the park is also home to Manhattan’s lone lighthouse – The Little Red Lighthouse – a landmark immortalized in children’s literature. Today, children and families visiting this area enjoy playing and picnicking along a newly revitalized and pristine shoreline that encompasses 159 acres of beautifully restored, natural space – thanks to the dedicated efforts of NYRP.<br>

          <div class="panel-body">The park name was taken from the adjacent Harlem streets, St. Nicholas Terrace (to the west) and St. Nicholas Avenue (to the east). These streets honor New Amsterdam’s patron saint, whose image adorned the masthead of the New Netherland that brought the first Dutch colonists to these shores. St. Nicholas of Myra is also known as the patron saint of children, sailors, bankers, pawnbrokers, travelers, and captives--as well as the inspiration for Father Christmas or Santa Claus.<br>
          <b>Location:</b> At the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue, 127th Street, St. Nicholas Terrace and 141st Street.
